# SPATCH: SPAtial Transcriptomics resource for subCellular and High-throughput platforms

---

### You can access our data online via: https://spatch.pku-genomics.org

## Key points
- Benchmarking of the most adavanced spatial transcriptomics technologies with subcellular resolution and large panel of genes.
- Benchmarking of multiple ST analysis tools on our datasets. 
- Using spatial proteomics (CODEX) of adjacent slides of spatial transciptomics.
- The code we used for analyzing spatial transcriptomics of multiple platform, i.e., data reading, spatial clustering, cell annotation and so on.
